Machine learning course and implementation of its academic exercises (Tarbiat Modares University)

## Part1
* Q1: Examine and comment on the following data set related to Parkinson's patients in terms of data structure, data type, and characteristics. Convert this data set to a data table using “Panⅾas” and explain how you can select the label. Store the label in a variable and the data (samples) in a separate variable (table). In this case, how many data and features are there? Then find at least three papers from 2018 onwards that have done classification on this dataset. Without going into detail, explain what their method was and what accuracy they achieved.

* Q2: Take 10 random points from the function (πx2(sin = y) in the interval [1 , 0]:  
a) Add noise to them and perform polynomial regression with degrees 1 to 9. (add noise to y_i's)    
b) Add 2 outlier points to the above 10 points and report the results of simple regression, lasso and Ridge. (Consider λ as appropriate)  
c) Report the sum of the distance between the predicted points and the original points as the error for each of the above cases (MAE).  
d) with the regularization values [10^-7, 10^-5] ∋ λ with a step length of 10^-7 for polynomial regression with degree 9, solve the problem of soft 1 and soft 2 regularization and the accuracy for λ to Plot as a graph. (Draw the graph as RMSE − λ)
